# Shared Templates

Canonical copies of shared document templates (packet shape, dashboard
shape, etc.) referenced by the per-domain `PACKET_TEMPLATE.md` files. Keep
domain-level templates in sync with this folder when the shared shape
changes.

## Global Operating Rule

Do not let proof work escape the proof environment.

Meaningful proof work includes: formal statements, Lean diagnostics, proof
attempts, generated scripts, generated files, source reviews, failed routes,
route pivots, Mathlib lookup failures, repair notes, final proof exports.

- If it matters to how the proof was found, record it.
- If it proves the theorem, verify it through Lean.
- If it fails, record the failure.
- If it uses another domain, record the dependency.
- If it becomes reusable, promote it to `shared/`.

Private reasoning is not proof authority. Lean decides. The ledger records.
